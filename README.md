**Objective:**

The project aimed to develop a robust neural network model for multi-class classification of brain tumor images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The primary goals included accurate identification and classification of four tumor types: Pituitary, Notumor, Meningioma, and Glioma.

**Methodology:**

Dataset Acquisition and Preprocessing:

Obtained a dataset comprising brain tumor images of varying sizes and types from kaggle.
Preprocessed the images by standardizing dimensions, performing data augmentation, and splitting into training and testing sets.

Model Development:

Constructed a CNN-based architecture leveraging Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dense, and Dropout layers for feature extraction and classification.
Optimized hyperparameters, including learning rate, batch size, and model depth, to enhance performance.

Model Training and Evaluation:

Trained the model on the prepared dataset, using Early Stopping and Reduce Learning Rate on Plateau to prevent overfitting and fine-tune learning.
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

**Results and Outcomes:**

Achieved an overall accuracy of approximately 98.6% on the test set.
Precision, recall, and F1-score analysis indicated strong performance across all tumor classes, with notable accuracy in Meningioma predictions.
Visualized model predictions and evaluated its robustness using test data visualization and confusion matrix analysis.
The model demonstrates promising potential for accurate and reliable brain tumor classification, offering a valuable tool for medical imaging analysis.

**Future Steps:**

Further refinement and fine-tuning of the model to improve performance.
Integration into a user-friendly interface or medical diagnostic tool for real-world applications.
Exploration of additional datasets or modalities to enhance the model's generalization and expand its applicability.
